ST Math (Spacial Temporal Math), developed by MIND Research Institute, is a curriculum-integrated educational math game to assist students in achieving k-12 math skills. It is designed to increase elementary school students' math expertise through visual learning. Current research on ST Math focuses on applying data-driven methods to understand gameplay and learning, and to identify opportunities for platform improvement and actionable recommendations.
