I am a Ph.D. Student in the Department of Computer Science at North Carolina State University since 2018. I am a member of [Game2Learn Lab](http://eliza.csc.ncsu.edu/research.html) supervised by [Dr. Tiffany Barnes](http://eliza.csc.ncsu.edu/). I joined the lab in Fall 2018.

My research interests revolve around Data Mining, Data Analytics, Educational Games, Intelligent Tutors and Applications of Machine Learning. I am currently involved with the [ST Math](https://www.stmath.com/) Project where I am applying machine learning and data driven methods on students' sequential gameplay data to understand patterns in gameplay and learning with an aim to find out how the game can be used to ensure better learning.

If you are interested in my research feel free to send me an email at <strong>pshabri@ncsu.edu.
